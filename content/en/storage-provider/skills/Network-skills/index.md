## Performance
As we are dealing with high network throughput requirements between multiple systems (to and from Boost, between the PC1 and PC2 workers and from PC2 to lotus-miner) it is worth learning to work with `iperf` and `iperf3` which allow for easy network benchmarking.

## Segmentation
VLAN tagging

## Redundancy
NIC bonding, LACP, MCLAG

## Architectures
- 2-tier / collapsed core
- spine-leaf
