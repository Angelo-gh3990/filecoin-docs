## Beginner's corner
Angelo to write a section on the use of refurbished hardware

## Community suggestions

Hardware requirements and architecture configurations evolve continually, based on evolving tech and software, market demands and available hardware. Because of this, we do not list any recommendations or examples on this page. Instead, look at the [example miner hardware profiles](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/6071) in the Lotus project GitHub discussions.

## Solo storage providing

Please take a look at the presentation Benjamin Hoejsbo <!--TODO STEF who? where from? why should I trust him? -- Bob: existing text, probably to be removed-->gave where they examine solo storage provider setups.
