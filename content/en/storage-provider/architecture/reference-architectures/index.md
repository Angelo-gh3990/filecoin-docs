## Beginner's corner
Angelo to write a section on the use of refurbished hardware

## Community suggestions

Hardware requirements and architecture suggestions constantly evolve based on market demands and available hardware. Because of this, we aren't listing any recommendations or examples on this page. Instead, look at the [Example Miner Hardware Profiles](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/6071) in the Lotus project GitHub discussions.

Please take a look at the presentation Benjamin Hoejsbo gave where he examines solo storage provider setups.
